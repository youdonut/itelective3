                                <p>Known to customers as the brand that delightfully serves Ihaw-Sarap food and
                                    Unli-Saya experience for the past 20 years.</p>
                                &nbsp;
                                <p>From a Hiligaynon word for Mr. Barbecue, Mang Inasal was established on December 12,
                                    2003 in Iloilo City by Edgar “Injap” Sia II. Apart from the delicious, craveable
                                    taste of its Chicken Inasal that has won the hearts of Filipinos, Mang Inasal was
                                    also the first to offer unlimited rice. Over the years, the brand has garnered
                                    numerous awards as a fast-growing local food company, an outstanding quick service
                                    restaurant (QSR), and an excellent Filipino franchise.</p>
                                &nbsp;
                                <p>
                                    Mang Inasal eventually became part of the portfolio of Jollibee Foods Corporation
                                    (JFC) in April 2016. Since then, Mang Inasal has observed the same high standards of
                                    Food, Service and Cleanliness that all JFC brands have been known for. At Mang
                                    Inasal, this commitment is applied across the business, assuring customers of food
                                    quality and safety that they can enjoy whether dine in, takeout, or delivery.


                                    To date, Mang Inasal operates over 570 stores nationwide, 97% of which are
                                    franchised.
